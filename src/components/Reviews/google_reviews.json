The online orders are terrible. The fit, adhesive, and size for my phone model are all awful. I had planned to order one for my laptop after doing my phone, but given the quality, it's not even worth 100 rupees. The worst part is that they don't respond to customer complaints\u2014they just disappear. I'm certain people who visited their shop had a different experience. So, please, when posting your review, mention whether it was an online order or an in-store purchase. And yes I got mine stuck in a mobile shop i dint do it myself. There is no response even after sending a video on how it looks . Pure wastage of 599 rupees."

I cannot tell if my phone has a skin or if its the base color. Simply changed the entire look of my phone!\n\nThe place is easy to find, with proper sitting and a ton of available options to choose from. As per the worker, they do skins for almost any type of device. So if you cannot find one for your phone online, I recommend going to this place.\n\nBest work for affordable or perhaps cheap price considering the skill it takes."

According to pure customer perspective, if you are a \"PHONE PERSON\" (the people who are can get that reference) and you seek Quality! MobiiWrap is the Place to be!\nI with my recent experience can share, I was struggling to find the best solution for my curved phone, wasted a lot of money on UV glass etc. Then got screen wrap from Mobiiwrap and i was carefree with my phone for more then two years.\nIf you are person who keeps your phone and keys in the same pocket you'll never be satisfied with any thing. A little bit of attention you don't have to worry about the Wrap/Skin getting damaged.\n\nYOU SEEK QUALITY SERVICE, YOU GO TO MOBIIWRAP!!"
